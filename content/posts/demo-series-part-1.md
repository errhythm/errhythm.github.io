# Understanding JavaScript Basics - Part 1

Welcome to the first part of our series on JavaScript Essentials. In this post, we'll cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript, including variables, data types, and basic operations.

## Variables and Data Types

JavaScript allows you to declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Here's a quick overview:

- `var`: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated.
- `let`: Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared.
- `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared.

```javascript
let name = 'John';
const age = 30;
```

## Basic Operations

JavaScript supports various operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations:

```javascript
let sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
let isEqual = 5 === 5; // Strict equality
```

Stay tuned for Part 2, where we'll dive into functions and control flow!
