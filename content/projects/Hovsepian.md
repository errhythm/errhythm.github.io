Berj Hovsepian wanted a wedding website that captured the elegance of a traditional wedding card, where guests could easily find event details and RSVP. The site was custom-built using WordPress and Elementor’s Hello theme, focusing on creating a minimalist, card-like design. The website also needed to be fully responsive and user-friendly across all devices, reflecting the couple's personal style while providing essential wedding information.

### Challenge: Wedding Card-Like Design

The first challenge was to translate the elegance of a physical wedding card into a digital format. Using Elementor, I crafted a clean and classic design with smooth transitions and subtle animations to replicate the feeling of a traditional wedding invitation. The layout was minimal and visually appealing, keeping the focus on the couple’s love story and wedding details.

### Challenge: Responsiveness Across Devices

Ensuring the site was fully responsive on all devices was a critical challenge. Since guests would be accessing the site from various devices, the design needed to maintain its elegance and functionality across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. By utilizing Elementor’s Hello theme and custom CSS, I ensured that every element scaled properly and maintained the visual integrity of the design.

### Challenge: Creating the RSVP Form

One of the most complex features was designing a custom RSVP form with specific functionality. The form needed to allow guests to RSVP for up to 5 people and specify their meal preferences—vegan or meat—for snacks. I integrated conditional logic into the form, ensuring guests could add up to 5 additional attendees and select their meal preferences seamlessly. This was a crucial feature to ensure that the wedding organizers could track guest preferences efficiently.

The wedding website for Berj and Emilia Hovsepian beautifully combined elegance with functionality. The project overcame technical challenges such as maintaining a card-like design across devices and creating a custom RSVP form with specific meal options and attendee limits. Built on WordPress with Elementor, the final product provided an engaging and user-friendly experience for wedding guests, while perfectly capturing the couple’s personal style.
