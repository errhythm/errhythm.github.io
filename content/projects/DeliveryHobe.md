Guess what? DeliveryHobe is now on your desktop! We're thrilled to introduce our redesigned website, fully optimized for desktop users. This means you can shop from your favorite local stores, get anything delivered in 30 minutes, and support your community, all from the comfort of your computer. With this update, you get a seamless experience on a larger screen, making it easier to browse products, navigate, and order. Whether you're at home, work, or anywhere else, DeliveryHobe is just a click away, ensuring you can always support local stores with ease.

## Day/Night Mode Madness

Alright, buckle up—DeliveryHobe’s website just got a glow-up, and it’s not just about looking pretty on your desktop (though it does that too). We’ve added a day/night mode that switches backgrounds based on real-time, because who doesn’t want their site to cosplay as the sky? By day, it’s rocking an orange-reddish vibe—like that morning coffee you spill everywhere—and by night, it’s a starry sky with a moon that actually moves with the clock. Yep, we’re basically flexing our JavaScript muscles while you order items from local dokans.

Picture this: it’s 6 AM, the sun’s creeping up, and our site flips to a warm, daylight gradient. Then, at 6 PM, bam—night mode kicks in with a dark, cosmic vibe, complete with twinkling stars and a moon that drifts across the screen like it’s late for a meeting. Why? Because static sites are so 2015, and we wanted to give our users a subtle nudge that, yeah, time’s still a thing. So yeah, order early!

## Surprise Categories – Shuffling the Deck

Imagine this: every time you hit reload or click that shiny "Surprise Me" button, the site deals you three random categories from its deck—like a digital slot machine for local Bangladeshi goodies. It’s part chaos, part genius, and 100% fun for users who love a little unpredictability with their shopping.

So, what’s the deal? On every page load or button mash, DeliveryHobe’s homepage fetches three random categories from its API, each stuffed with up to seven products (down from eight—more on that later). Think “Eggs,” “Digital Subscriptions,” or “Pet Stuff” popping up out of nowhere, tempting you to explore. It’s like the site’s saying, “Hey, you didn’t know you needed this, but trust me, you do.” For users, it’s a treasure hunt—random categories keep the homepage alive, nudging them to discover stuff they’d never search for.

## Product Cards, Categories, and Search Get a Facelift

Nobody likes a clunky shopping experience, so, we’ve got sleeker product cards, category pages that actually make sense, and a search bar that doesn’t feel like it’s gaslighting you. The product cards have shed their old skin and stepped into 2025 with style. Whether you’re on your phone or laptop, these cards feel like they’re made just for you.

![Search in Category Page](https://cdn.errhythm.me/projects/DeliveryHobeSearch.png)

Ever clicked into “Snacks” and felt lost in a sea of options? Not anymore! Our category pages are now your personal guide to necessary goodies. You’ll see neat sections with a “View All” link that takes you right to the good stuff—no guessing games. It’s less “where am I?” and more “oh, I need that!”

## How Long It Will Take, But Make It Chill

The new tracking bar is your order’s life story in four steps: Ordered, Processing, Out for Delivery, and Delivered. Each step lights up with a little icon that pulses when it’s active—think a shopping bag for “Ordered” or a bike for “Out for Delivery.” Whether you’re on your phone or a big screen, it adjusts to fit perfectly, with a smooth progress line that shows exactly how close your order is. No more wondering—it’s all right there.

The updated Delivery Man Card shows their name, number, and status—like “active” or “on the move”—with a cool avatar and a green dot that says “they’re on it.” There’s even a call button that glows green, so you can ring them if you’re like, “Hey, I’m behind the red gate!” It’s personal, it’s slick, and it makes the wait feel friendlier.

This isn’t just prettier (though it totally is)—it’s built to keep you calm and clued in. We fine-tuned it so it loads fast, looks great on any device, and gives you real updates without the guesswork. Next time you order from [deliveryhobe.com](http://deliveryhobe.com/), track it with your tracking ID and see the magic for yourself. Let us know how it feels—we’re here to make it even better!

## Picking Your Area Just Got Way Easier

Say hello to our shiny new area selection modal. It’s faster, cleaner, and makes picking your delivery spot feel like a breeze. Gone are the days of squinting at a clunky list or wondering if we deliver to your corner of town. The new area selection modal pops up with a sleek design—think bold headers, a search bar that’s ready to roll, and a list of areas that doesn’t make you scroll into next week. Type “Mirpur” or “Dhanmondi,” and boom—it’s right there. You can even use CTRL + L to bring the area selection modal!

## Optimized Cart System: Add, Tweak, Checkout—No Drama

Add a product—say, a pack of chips or some late-night noodles—and it’s in there instantly, no delay. Want two instead of one? Tap the little plus sign, and it updates without a hitch. It’s all smooth, fast, and drama-free. It’s got a fresh vibe with clear prices (discounts included!) and a layout that works whether you’re on your phone or desktop.

## Memes Take Over Our Hero Section (And It’s Hilarious)

We’ve ditched the boring old banners and swapped them for memes that’ll make you laugh, nod, and maybe even hit “order now” faster than you can say “Dola Hobe.” Here’s why this is our most epic update yet.

![Memes in Hero Section](https://cdn.errhythm.me/projects/DeliveryHobeHeroMemes.png)

Scroll to the top of [deliveryhobe.com](http://deliveryhobe.com/), and you’ll see what we mean. Instead of some snoozy stock photo, you might catch a knight dodging a “Baat A Porle” trap or a cheeky “Raw Hobe” vibe. These aren’t just random giggles—they’re tied to stuff you can actually order, like lube from the pharmacy. It’s a carousel of chaos that slides through every few seconds, keeping you hooked while you figure out what’s next. Who doesn’t love a good meme? It’s like a mini dopamine hit before you even get to the menu.

## Quick Peek at Your On-the-Way Deliveries

Ever ordered a bunch of stuff and then wondered, “Wait, where’s it all at?” We’ve got you covered with a brand-new feature: a quick “Ongoing Deliveries” button. Spot it on the homepage—it’s that little yellow icon shows a box icon. One click, and you’ll see every delivery currently zooming your way, complete with tracking details.

It will only work on your own device as we implemented this as cookie for now. You’ll get a neat list of what’s out there—maybe that spicy snack pack or a last-minute grocery haul—each with a mini tracking bar showing where it’s at: “Processing,” “Out for Delivery,” or almost at your door. No more digging through SMS; it’s all right there, fast and easy. Next time you’re juggling multiple orders (we know you’re a pro), hit that button and stay in the loop without breaking a sweat.

And there you have it, folks—DeliveryHobe’s big desktop debut, packed with everything from meme-powered ads to a cart that doesn’t ghost you. Countless late nights, way too much tea, and a whole lot of “does this moon move right?” moments went into making this site feel alive. But seeing it all come together—day/night mode, surprise categories, those slick product cards—it’s been worth every second. Hat’s off to Naseef Fatemi for the design, and my Project Manager Erfan Mahmud and not to forget about Asif, the frontend engineer of the team as well. Big love to my coworkers, though—they’ve been my hype squad, tossing ideas and keeping me from losing it when the code wouldn’t cooperate. So, what’s next? Hop onto [deliveryhobe.com](http://deliveryhobe.com/), order that snack you’ve been eyeing (or let the memes convince you), and support your local stores in style. Got feedback? Drop it below—I’m all ears, and my tea stash depends on your thoughts. Let’s keep the good vibes rolling!
