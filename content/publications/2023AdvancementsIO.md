Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are very powerful tools that are used to convert handwritten texts or digital data on an image to machine readable texts. The importance of Optical Character Recognition for handwritten documents cannot be overstated due to its widespread use in human transactions. OCR technology allows for the conversion of various types of documents or images into machine understandable data that can be analyzed, edited, and searched. In earlier years, manually crafted feature extraction techniques were used on comparatively small datasets which were not good enough for practical use. With the advent of deep learning, it was possible to perform OCR tasks more efficiently and accurately than ever before. In this paper, several OCR techniques have been reviewed. We mostly reviewed works on Bangla scripts and also gave an overview of the contemporary works and recent progresses in OCR technology (e.g. TrOCR, transformer w/CNN). It was found that for Bangla handwritten texts, CNN models like DenseNet121, ResNet50, MobileNet etc are the commonly adopted techniques because of their state of the art performance in object recognition tasks. Using an RNN layer like LSTM or GRU alongside the base CNN-based architecture, the accuracy can be further improved. TrOCR is a fairly new technique in this field that shows promise. Experimental results show that in synthetic IAM handwriting dataset it showed a Character Error Rate (CER) of 2.89. The goal of this paper is to provide a summary of the research conducted on character recognition of handwritten documents in Bangla Scripts and suggest future research directions.
