In the age of information overload, where the world is getting increasingly digital, traditional methods of learning are becoming tedious and extensively outdated. Imagine a system with just a few clicks that can quickly generate perplexing questions and enlightening solutions from a given text. Likewise, this paper represents a groundbreaking system that uses stateof-the-art of natural language processing techniques to analyze subject-specific chapters to create questions and corresponding solutions of varying lengths. The systemâ€™s versatility as an ideal tool for a wide range of users, including students, researchers, and educators, is a result of its capability to handle a wide range of domains. By offering questions of insight along with appropriate answers, this aforementioned structure demonstrated its extraordinary accuracy and competency in our studies on an array of informational datasets. Altering the learning process and promoting knowledge discovery, this program is flexible in delivering brief or comprehensible solutions to inquiries, having the potential to completely change how individuals interact with written material, whether they are reading for short reference or conducting any depth research. Our suggested framework establishes a dynamic platform for immediate information that enables people to learn substantially more and comprehend any topic in depth. With this leading-edge method, bid goodbye to exhausting manual question generation and get ready to embrace a new era of seamless and fruitful learning with this cutting-edge system.
