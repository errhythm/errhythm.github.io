Cutaneous abnormalities, commonly known as skin lesions, form a broad spectrum of skin irregularities that necessitates proper identification and immediate treatment. A significant development in the utilization of machine learning approaches for analyzing medical imagery has been observed recently - particularly its effectiveness in the automatic detection and categorization of skin lesions. This academic study discusses an extensive technique for recognizing and categorizing skin lesions using machine learning protocols. The key cornerstone is the HAM10000 dataset, which comprises 10,000 images portraying discolored skin conditions varying in types and patient demographics. Our analysis examines the efficiency of Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in detecting and classifying such tensions on the dermis. Stringent evaluation procedures involving Accuracy, Precision, Recall rate, along with F1-score have been employed to measure these algorithms’ efficacy alongside their possible influence within clinical settings. Overall model performance was strong, with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) acquiring the highest accuracy of 94.8%, while Decision Tree gave an accuracy of 94.3%, Random Forest coming to a close third with an accuracy of 94.1%, and finally K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), which gave us an accuracy of 93.7%. The presented methodology contributes meaningfully to progress in dermatology by generating precise diagnostic instruments that are beneficial for both healthcare professionals as well as patients suffering from these anomalies. This inquiry underscores how machine learning could elevate health outcomes by improving early recognition processes and enabling personalized therapeutics directed at treating skin lesions effectively.
